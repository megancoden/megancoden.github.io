I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2023, where I studied both Computer Science and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. I was also a research assistant in Pat Schloss’ lab, where I used machine learning to predict the severity of Clostridioides difficile infections.\nOutside of work, I am also on an adult gymnastics team called “Jurassic Gymnastics.” I also enjoy playing volleyball, swimming, reading, and going on walks."
